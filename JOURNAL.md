# June 2nd: Design

So today I listed the elements I might need for this project and drew a brief image of how things work together.

and... I forget the notebook. image will be updated tomorrow.

# June 4th: Design a draft

Well, actually I don't really know what I'm doing today.

I only drag some random thing that seems to fit on a drone on the scheme and try to make a PCB that shaped like a drone.

Then at the end I finally realized that the PCB doesn't have to shape like a drone but the 3D printed case, so I just forget everything and took a break from whatever mess I was doing. It was so tired to see my 2h worth of work being given up. Seems like I need a better plan for this project.

**Total time spent: 2h**

# June 5th: Went to a local store to look up the items

I went to a local electronic store to see if I can find anything that might be on the design for [MagFire](https://github.com/KnowScratcher/MagFire). Meanwhile, I collected some data for the BOM of this project as well.
